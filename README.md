# First automation test

This is my first automation test on website "http://test.qa.rs/"

The goal is to test the functionality of ordering item(s) on the given website.

Reminder:

When first cloning the repository run the following commands:
```
npm install
```
To run test, execute the command:
```
npm test
```

To filter through specific tests, execute command:
```
npm test -- --grep 'test name'
```
